# Udacity scholarship memory game project submission
This is my take on the memory game project, which is meant for the udacity FEND scholarship.

# Installing and usage
Simply download the zipped project file, unpack it anywhere in your hard drive and run the index.html with your favorite browser.

# Game information
My project has two different gamemodes, the classic style memory game, where you simply try to find pairs as fast as possible, whilst your perfomance is being rated.
"Memory attack" gamemode is a more serious and very different approach to the classical version of the game, where you battle against the time.

# Memory attack gamemode
The main goal for the player is to find as many pairs as possible within the initial 60 second timeframe. However, as not to make it too easy, the game has been modified and has gone over a total rework to make much more challenging.

Card deck is shuffled every 20 seconds, so hurry up with finding those pairs!
Each mismatch will penalize you with -2 seconds.
Each match rewards you with extra 10 seconds of time.
To make things bit more interesting, player will have 5 special "perks" at his/her disposal at any time.
Each perk can only be used once per match, so use them wisely.
The game ends when the time has run out.
